                  <p class="card-text">As a Meta University Software Engineering intern, I had ten weeks to learn as much
                    as I could about iOS app development. The program began with a three-week bootcamp organized by 
                    CodePath. During the three weeks, I was introduced to Objective C and iOS development for the first 
                    time and worked on three projects that mimicked Flixster, Twitter, and Instagram. For the next seven 
                    weeks, we brought our own, original app ideas to life by leveraging what we learned during 
                    bootcamp and collaborating with full-time engineers. I met with my Intern Manager and 
                    Project Peer several times a week to update them on my progress and get their feedback on my code. 
                    By the end of the 10-week program, I left with a strong understanding of iOS development, a complete 
                    application I designed and developed, and many friends and mentors</p>

                      peers and mentors used daily. From updating the faculty database with more inclusive language 
                      and fields to upgrading filtering options and algorithms on the capstone project portal, I had 
                      the unique opportunity to take my computer science knowledge outside of the classroom and apply 
                      it to actual tickets within the collegeâ€™s eco-system of applications. I also worked closely with 
                      three full-time engineers to understand how large-scale applications are managed and gain 
                      proficiency with industry tools such as Bitbucket, Jira, and Github.
